The ATDDBrowser is the main hub for managing testing entities.
It consists of two lists, one for Watchers and one for Travis Statuses.

The ATDDBrowser holds a reference to all Watchers and TravisStatuses through their respective class variables.

It registers itself in the Squeak World Menu and can be opened via Apps->Test Auto Runner.
