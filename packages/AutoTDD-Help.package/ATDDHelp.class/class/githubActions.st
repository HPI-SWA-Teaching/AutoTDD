			'GitHub actions will show you the latest state, commit message, branch, and author of the most recent GitHub action run on your project. You can add a new GitHub action by clicking the ''Add GitHub Action'' button in the browser. You can provide an optional personal access token which will allow you to bypass the 60 request per hour limit. GitHub actions are  shown in the browser under the ''GitHub Actions'' section and will refresh their contents automatically within a user-defined interval.
			

Clicking on the ''Results'' button open a new window showing all GitHub action runs and their corresponding logs.'
