		title: 'Using Watchers'
		contents: 'A watcher specifies a set of tests as well as a set of classes and/or categories to observe. Whenever the watcher observes a change in one of these classes, it will execute all of its tests. These tests will run in a background process without freezing the image and will update the watcher''s color in the browser according to their status. 
		
To view a detailed report on the test results you can click on the ''Results'' button in the browser under the ''Watchers'' section. Watchers can be manually run by selecting them in the browser and clicking the ''Run'' button. 
		
You are free to create as many Watchers as you like.'
