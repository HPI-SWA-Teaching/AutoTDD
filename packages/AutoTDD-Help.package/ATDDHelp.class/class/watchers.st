			'A Watcher specifies a set of tests to execute and a set of classes or categories to watch. Whenever a method in these watched classes or
categories changes, the specified tests are executed. The tests will run in a background process without freezing the image. You are free to create as many Watchers as you like.

For Watchers, a click on the Results button in the Browser will show a detailed description of all tests that have been run.'
