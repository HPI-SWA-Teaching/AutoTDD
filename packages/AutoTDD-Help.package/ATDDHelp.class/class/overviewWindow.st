			'The overview window is a minimal, unobtrusive UI which contains  a summary of the state of a user-defined subset of all local watchers, Travis statuses, and GitHub Actions. In order to create an overview window you can open the browser, select at least one watcher, Travis status, or GitHub Action, and then click on the ''Create Overview'' button on the top of the window.
			
Clicking on the status image in the overview window will open up a detailed log of the corresponding testing entity''s results. The overview can be re-expanded into the full AutoTDD browser at any time by clicking the ''Expand'' button.'
