			'The browser is the primary form of interacting with AutoTDD. It contains a list of all of your locally defined watchers as well as any Travis statuses and GitHub actions which you have added. Testing entities are managed from this GUI; this includes adding, editing, removing, and inspecting testing entities. The browser can be opened at any time by clicking on "Apps -> Test Auto Runner" in the upper menu bar. All of your watchers are saved upon closing the browser as well as your image. '
