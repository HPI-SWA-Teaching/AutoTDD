			'The Browser is our main GUI which will show all the Watchers and their current state as well as all Travis Statuses with the corresponding build state, the commit message, the branch and the author of the latest Travis build. It can also be used to create, edit and remove Watchers and Travis Statuses.
		
You can open the Browser under "Apps -> Test Auto Runner."'
