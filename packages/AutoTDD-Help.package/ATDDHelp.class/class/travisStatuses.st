			'You can create a Travis Status that will show you the build state, the commit message, the branch and the author of the latest Travis build of your repository. Travis Statuses are also
shown in the Browser and will refresh their contents automatically within an interval that you can also specify.

For Travis Statuses, a click on the Results button will show all Travis builds and the corresponding logs in a special GUI.'
